<p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019.
COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, unexplained loss of taste or smell, diarrhea and headache. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have caused death
The new coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. Prevention involves frequent hand-washing, coughing into the bend of your elbow, staying home when you are sick and wearing a cloth face covering if you can't practice social distancing.</p>
<h1><strong>Should You Be Worried about the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak?</strong></h1>
<p>Outbreaks of new (novel) virus infections among people are always public health concerns. Public health officials, scientists, researchers, media and the public should take this current COVID-19 outbreak seriously and monitor it closely. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to individuals is dependent on exposure. To date, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients and other close contacts, as well as immunocompromised individuals. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.

It’s understandable that some may be overwhelmed, or even frightened, by news about the outbreak. What can one do about these worries and concerns? One of the most important things that can be done is to monitor reputable sources like the CDC, WHO, and other expert agencies and people. 

The rapid dissemination of information, including misinformation, during an outbreak is a relatively recent development. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat were still years away from being founded in 2002, when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rattled southern China, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800, including 44 Canadians. In today’s age of social media, there is a plethora of sites from which anyone can obtain information, and many of them are not credible or vetted by medical or scientific experts. A misinformed tweet, post, or photo can easily convince someone to disregard proper hygiene or create shock value about the risk of contracting an illness.

It might be worthwhile to tune out social media or other non-reputable sources if it creates panic. I always tell my students, friends and family members that “microbes don’t read the book” with regards to our understanding them. The microbes don’t read or listen to social media either. Try to stay informed, and listen to experts and sources that do offer facts but not sensationalism.

When I was working on my PhD dissertation regarding MRSA adaptation, I immersed myself in Social Representation Theory (SRT). SRT offers a new approach for studying how the media and citizens construct societal and political issues colouring our age, or some specific time period (e.g. climate change, health stigmas like tuberculosis, etc.). We rarely want to admit that we are all influenced by media (especially social media) with respect to fear. It literally can create its own reproduction rate of spread among the general public, as well as those in charge or experts. We are all human. And, in the age of Facebook, Twitter, and other media outlets we all participate in being vectors to spread these dangerous and fear-invoking story lines.</p>
